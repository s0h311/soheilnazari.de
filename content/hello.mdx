### Hello,

I'm Soheil, a Computer Science (well actually [_Wirtchaftsinformatik_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_informatics))
student and Full Stack Engineer from Germany's most delightful city Hamburg.

I enjoy reading books. My favourites are Harari's _Sapiens_ and _Homo Deus_, Goethe's _Faust_ and _Robinson Crouso_
that I read only once as a kid in the turkish edition.
From time to time I go for a run in my Onitsuka's GT-2000.

I admire a couple of people for - some of the, certianly not all the - things that they have done, and standed for.
Some of the names are: M. Ghandi, J. Dimon and
