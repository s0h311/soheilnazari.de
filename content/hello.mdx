# Hello

_31 July 2023_

I'm Soheil, a Computer Science (well actually [_Wirtchaftsinformatik_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_informatics))
student and Full Stack Engineer from Germany's most delightful city, Hamburg.

I enjoy reading books. Some of my favourites are Harari's _Sapiens_ and _Homo Deus_, Goethe's _Faust_
and _Robinson Crouso_, the latter I read only once as a kid in the Turkish edition.
From time to time I'd go for a run.

I admire a couple of people for - some of, certainly not all - the things they have done and stand for.
