# Hello

_31 July 2023_

---

I'm Soheil, a Computer Science (well actually [_Wirtchaftsinformatik_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_informatics))
student and Full Stack Engineer from Germany's most delightful city, Hamburg.

I enjoy reading books. Some of my favourites are Harari's _Sapiens_ and _Homo Deus_ and Goethe's _Faust_.
From time to time I'd like to go for a run.

My current interests are Web Development with React, Next, Vue, Nuxt and TypeScript.
Also I'm looking forward to experiment with WASM (with Kotlin or Rust) and React Native in the near feature.

I admire a couple of people for - some of, certainly not all - the things they have done and stand for.
