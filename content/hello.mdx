# Hello

_11 January 2024_

---

My name is Soheil. I'm a Computer Science (well actually [_Wirtchaftsinformatik_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_informatics))
student and Full Stack Engineer from Germany's most delightful city, Hamburg.

I enjoy reading books. Some of my favourites are Harari's _Sapiens_ and _Homo Deus_ and Goethe's _Faust_.
I also like running.

My current interests are Web Development with React, Next, Vue, Nuxt and TypeScript.

I admire a couple of people for - some of, certainly not all - the things they have done and stand for.
